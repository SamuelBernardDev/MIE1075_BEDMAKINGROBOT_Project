# MIE1075_BEDMAKINGROBOT_Project

Introduction: This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an AI-powered bed-making robot by applying advanced robotics and artificial intelligence techniques for the course MIE1075 - Artificial Intelligence for Robotics I. The key tasks include localization, path and motion planning, image process, pose and grasp estimation.


## Project Files and Their Roles

### Code
1. **`yolo_demo.py`**  
   - Performs object detection using YOLO to identify specific items.

2. **`yolo_state_recognize.py`**  
   - Recognizes and classifies the state of the bed (made or unmade) for action planning with using the Ultralytics API

### Demos
1. **`final_hard-coded_simulation.mp4`**  
   - Demonstrates the complete bed-making process through a simulated robotic workflow.

2. **`yolo_demo.mp4`**  
   - Displays the YOLO object detection system with an example video.

3. **`yolo_state_recognize_output.jpg`**  
   - Shows an example of the robot detecting whether the bed is made or unmade.
